# Networking Projects:

# Project 1 - Python Proxy Redux
The purpose of this project is to get more practice with using Python's socket library,
as well as reviewing the Berkeley sockets API. 

Instructions:
Redo the System's Project "Proxy Lab" but in Python, rather than C.

# Project 2 - Reliable Data Transfer
The purpose of this project is to solidify your understanding of techniques for providing reliable communication over an unreliable medium. The task is to implement standard protocol and socket
functions for a reliable transport protocol called RDT. The professor (Dr. Pohly) has intentionally modeled the project structure after the Linux kernelâ€™s sockets implementation, so that students experience the way that real network protocols are implemented in an operating system. 

To aid in testing, the protocol runs not on a real network but on a network simulation which
provides fine-grained control over packet corruption and loss.

Implemented files: rdt.py
